            represented a bold gambit to alter the strategic balance. President Kennedy's response - a naval 
            quarantine rather than immediate military action - demonstrated both firmness and restraint. 
            The crisis revealed critical lessons about nuclear brinkmanship, the importance of communication 
            channels between superpowers, and the role of miscalculation in international relations.""",

            The division of Berlin represents more than a physical barrier - it symbolizes the ideological 
            divide between East and West. NATO's commitment to West Berlin's defense remains firm, but 
            questions persist about escalation scenarios. The presence of Western troops in Berlin serves 
            as both a tripwire and a guarantee. Any Soviet move against West Berlin would trigger an 
            automatic Western response, potentially escalating to nuclear confrontation.""",

            for Western policy. Ideological disputes over the nature of revolution and coexistence with 
            capitalism have evolved into a fundamental split in the Communist world. China's criticism of 
            Soviet 'revisionism' and Moscow's concern over Chinese 'adventurism' create new dynamics in 
            the Cold War. The West must carefully consider how to respond to this division without
