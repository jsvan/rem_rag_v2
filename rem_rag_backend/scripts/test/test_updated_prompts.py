The crisis began when American U-2 spy planes discovered Soviet medium-range ballistic missiles under construction in Cuba, just 90 miles from the Florida coast. These missiles, capable of carrying nuclear warheads, could strike most of the continental United States within minutes of launch.

President John F. Kennedy faced an extraordinary dilemma. Military advisors pushed for immediate air strikes or a full-scale invasion of Cuba. However, Kennedy understood that such actions could trigger Soviet retaliation in Berlin or elsewhere, potentially escalating to nuclear war. Instead, he chose a middle path: a naval blockade of Cuba.

The resolution came through secret negotiations. Kennedy agreed to publicly pledge not to invade Cuba and privately promised to remove American Jupiter missiles from Turkey. In exchange, Khrushchev would withdraw the Soviet missiles from Cuba."""

Source Materials:

Source 1 (1962):
The Cuban Missile Crisis demonstrated how superpowers could be pushed to the brink by miscalculation and misunderstanding. Kennedy's advisors were divided between hawks demanding immediate military action and doves seeking diplomatic solutions. (Year: 1962)

Source 2 (1989):
The fall of the Berlin Wall showed how even the most seemingly permanent political structures could crumble rapidly when popular movements gained momentum. East German authorities lost control as citizens took matters into their own hands. (Year: 1989)

Source 3 (1990):
China's economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping represented a careful balance between maintaining Communist Party control and unleashing market forces. The state retained ultimate authority while allowing controlled experimentation in Special Economic Zones. (Year: 1990)"""

Write a concise synthesis in exactly 2 short paragraphs (150-200 words total) that directly addresses the core issue WITHOUT restating or referencing "the question" or "the implicit question".

Start your response by integrating the key concept from the question naturally into your opening sentence. For example, if the question is about "stability of states in crisis", begin with something like "Stability of states in the face of crisis reveals..."

Be direct and specific. Reveal non-obvious patterns across the time periods and offer insights that emerge from the juxtaposition.
