# REM RAG Continuation Prompt

## Project Context

I'm working on REM RAG - a novel RAG system that mimics human learning through reading and dreaming cycles. The system processes Foreign Affairs articles chronologically to build understanding over time.

## Recent Accomplishments

1. **Modular Implant Function**: Created `src/core/implant.py` that unifies the "How does this relate to what we already know?" logic across all components. This eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent behavior.

2. **Sentence-Aware Chunking**: Implemented `src/data_processing/sentence_chunker.py` based on the original design, creating ~300-word chunks that split at sentence boundaries for better semantic coherence.

3. **REM Cycle Integration**: Enhanced `src/core/rem_cycle.py` to include the implant step, so REM insights are compared with existing knowledge and stored as synthesis nodes.

4. **Concise Outputs**: Updated all prompts to generate focused syntheses (50-150 words) instead of verbose explanations.

5. **Complete Test Suite**: Created scripts for testing and visualization:
   - `run_1922_fixed.py` - Basic processing
   - `run_1922_with_rem.py` - With quarterly REM cycles  
   - `add_rem_to_1922.py` - Add REM to existing data
   - `test_rem_step.py` - Visualize single REM step
   - `test_chunker_comparison.py` - Compare chunking approaches

## Current State

- **Database**: 387 nodes from 1922 Foreign Affairs (chunks, summaries, syntheses, REM insights)
- **Chunking**: Using sentence-aware chunker (300 words, sentence boundaries)
- **Synthesis**: All components use modular implant function
- **REM**: Successfully discovering patterns about sovereignty, intervention, post-war order

## Key Files

- `/Users/jsv/Projects/foreign_affairs/rem_rag_v2/` - Main project directory
- `src/core/implant.py` - Modular implant function
- `src/data_processing/sentence_chunker.py` - New chunker
- `src/core/rem_cycle.py` - REM implementation with implant
- `scripts/` - All test and experiment scripts
- `TODO.md` - Updated task list
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Full READING Cycle**: Update `src/core/reading_cycle.py` to use sentence-aware chunker and complete the entity extraction â†’ implant pipeline

2. **Process 1920s Decade**: Run all 304 articles (1920-1929) with quarterly REM cycles to analyze decade-wide patterns

3. **Entity Resolution**: Implement fuzzy matching for entity aliases (e.g., USSR vs Soviet Union)

## Design Philosophy

- Every piece of information is "implanted" by comparing with existing knowledge
- Chunks are sentence-aware for semantic coherence
- Syntheses are concise (50-150 words) and focused on insights
- Original content is preserved; syntheses are stored separately
- REM cycles discover patterns by connecting 3 disparate nodes

## Technical Details

- ChromaDB for vector storage with metadata filtering
- OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for embeddings
- GPT-4o-mini for synthesis generation
- Lists stored as JSON strings in ChromaDB metadata
- Datetime using timezone-aware objects

Please help me continue building this system, focusing on the next priority tasks.
