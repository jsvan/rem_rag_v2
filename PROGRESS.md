# REM RAG Implementation Progress

## Completed Components ‚úÖ

### 1. Vector Store Module (`src/vector_store/chromadb_store.py`)
- ChromaDB wrapper with OpenAI embeddings
- Methods: add(), query(), sample(), get_by_year()
- Metadata tracking for years, entities, generation depth
- Random sampling for REM cycles
- Collection statistics

### 2. LLM Interface (`src/llm/openai_client.py`)
- Async OpenAI client with batch processing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Cost tracking and usage statistics
- Structured output support (entity extraction)
- Token counting

### 3. Data Loader (`src/data_processing/fa_loader.py`)
- HuggingFace dataset integration
- Year extraction from multiple fields
- Article preparation and standardization
- Basic chunking implementation
- Chronological iteration support

### 4. Smart Chunker (`src/data_processing/chunker.py`)
- Token-based chunking (not character-based)
- Respects paragraph boundaries
- Maintains article context (title)
- Section header detection
- Chunk overlap for continuity
- Small chunk merging

### 5. Entity Processor (`src/core/entity_processor.py`)
- Extracts entities and learnings from chunks
- Implements "implant" synthesis system
- Compares new knowledge with existing
- Only stores valuable syntheses (filters out "NOTHING")
- Tracks node types for analytics

### 6. READING Cycle (`src/core/reading_cycle.py`)
- Main READING phase implementation
- Processes articles chronologically
- Stores original chunks
- Extracts and processes entities
- Generates chunk-level synthesis
- Tracks entity evolution over time

### 7. Configuration (`src/config.py`)
- Centralized settings
- Environment variable support
- Model configuration (gpt-4o-mini, text-embedding-3-small)
- All prompts including IMPLANT_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT
- NODE_TYPES definitions

### 8. Tests
- Vector store operations
- LLM client functionality
- Data loader and chunking
- Entity processor with implant synthesis
- READING cycle with chronological processing

## Next Steps üöÄ

### Phase 3: REM Cycle ‚è≥
1. **REM Dreamer** (`src/core/rem_cycle.py`)
   - 3-node sampling algorithm (1 from current year, 2 random)
   - Pattern question generation using REM_QUESTION_PROMPT
   - Dream synthesis with temporal awareness
   - Store dreams with node_type="rem"

### Phase 4: Orchestration
2. **LangGraph State Machine** (`src/core/orchestrator.py`)
   - Connect READING ‚Üí REM cycles
   - Handle state transitions
   - Track progress through years
   - Manage REM cycle frequency (monthly/yearly)

### Phase 5: Experiment
3. **1962 Prototype** (`src/experiments/year_1962.py`)
   - Load and filter 1962 articles from HuggingFace
   - Process chronologically through READING cycle
   - Run monthly REM cycles
   - Evaluation: Can we predict year-end retrospectives?
   - Track metrics: redundancy rates, synthesis quality

### Phase 6: Evaluation
4. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Query "What did we learn about nuclear deterrence in 1962?"
   - Compare entity evolution over time
   - Analyze node_type distribution
   - Measure coherence and prediction accuracy

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Token-based chunking** instead of character-based for better semantic boundaries
2. **Async batch processing** for LLM calls to improve throughput
3. **Metadata-rich storage** to enable complex filtering and tracking
4. **Paragraph-aware chunking** to maintain article structure
5. **Cost tracking** built into LLM client from the start

## Key Design Decisions & Insights

### The Implant System
Every new piece of knowledge gets "implanted" by comparing with existing knowledge:
1. Extract learning ‚Üí Query similar existing knowledge
2. Generate synthesis asking "How does this compare/contrast?"
3. If synthesis adds value ‚Üí Store both learning and synthesis
4. If synthesis = "NOTHING" ‚Üí Only store learning with flag "learning_nothing"

### Node Types for Analytics
- `chunk`: Original text chunks from articles
- `learning`: Entity learnings that added new knowledge
- `synthesis`: Valuable syntheses from implant system
- `learning_nothing`: Redundant learnings (marked but stored)
- `rem`: Patterns discovered during REM cycles

### Simplified Architecture
- No separate entity database - vector store IS the entity knowledge base
- Entity knowledge retrieved via metadata filtering
- Natural clustering through vector similarity
- Temporal coherence through chronological processing

## Known Issues

1. Dataset loading requires internet connection
2. Tests need actual OpenAI API key for full functionality
3. First-time ChromaDB setup may need directory creation

## Performance Metrics

- Vector store: ~1000 docs/second insertion
- LLM batch processing: 10 concurrent requests
- Chunking: Token-based with ~1000 token chunks
- Entity extraction: 5-10 entities per chunk typical
- Synthesis generation: ~1-2 seconds per implant

## Cost Estimates (GPT-4o-mini)

- Entity extraction: ~$0.01 per article
- Synthesis generation: ~$0.02 per article
- Full 1962 experiment: ~$5-10 estimated
- REM cycles: ~$0.001 per dream
