# Current problematic prompt
CURRENT_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """New information: {new_info}

Existing knowledge: {existing_knowledge}

Write exactly 1 short paragraph (50-100 words) explaining how this new information relates to existing knowledge. Focus on:
- Key similarities or contradictions
- How it extends or challenges what we know
- The most important new insight (if any)

Be concise and specific. Keep your response to a single, impactful paragraph.

If this adds nothing new or is simply a repetition of what we already know, respond with exactly: NOTHING"""


# Improved prompt that focuses on the actual insight
IMPROVED_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """New information: {new_info}

Existing knowledge: {existing_knowledge}

Based on comparing these passages, state the key insight or pattern that emerges. Write exactly 1 paragraph (50-100 words) that:

- States the actual pattern/insight directly (not how passages "relate")
- Uses specific terms and concepts from the passages
- Focuses on what we learn about the topic itself
- Avoids meta-language like "reinforces", "extends", "highlights"

Example good synthesis: "Humanitarian interventions create moral hazard by encouraging weaker parties to escalate conflicts expecting foreign support, while simultaneously nations hesitate to deploy ground troops, resulting in delayed interventions that fail to prevent atrocities like Rwanda."

If this adds nothing new or is simply repetition, respond with exactly: NOTHING"""


# Alternative prompt focusing on contradiction/tension
ALTERNATIVE_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """New information: {new_info}

Existing knowledge: {existing_knowledge}

Synthesize what these passages reveal about the topic. In exactly 1 paragraph (50-100 words):

- State the core insight, pattern, or contradiction discovered
- Use the specific language and terms from the passages
- Focus on the subject matter, not the relationship between texts
- Write as if explaining the pattern to someone unfamiliar with these sources

Begin directly with the insight (e.g., "Economic sanctions often...", "Nuclear deterrence requires...", "Great powers maintain influence through...")

If this adds nothing new, respond with exactly: NOTHING"""
